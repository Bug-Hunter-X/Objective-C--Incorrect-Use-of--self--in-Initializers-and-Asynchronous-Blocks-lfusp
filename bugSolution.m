The corrected version ensures `self` is only accessed after `super`'s initializer finishes and uses `__weak` to prevent retain cycles in asynchronous blocks.

```objectivec
- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        self.myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
        // Correct: Access myObject after initialization
        [self.myObject doSomething];
    }
    return self;
}

// ... in some method
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self; // Prevents retain cycle
    if (weakSelf) {
        // Access self through weakSelf 
        [weakSelf updateUI];
    }
});
```
By following these practices, you can prevent crashes and memory leaks stemming from the incorrect use of `self` in Objective-C.
