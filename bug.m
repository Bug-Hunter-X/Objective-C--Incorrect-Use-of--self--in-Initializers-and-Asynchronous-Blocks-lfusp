In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves using `self` incorrectly within a method, particularly in situations involving initialization or asynchronous operations.  For instance, consider a scenario where you initialize a property within a designated initializer but accidentally use `self` before the superclass initializer has completed. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes because `self` might not yet be fully initialized.

```objectivec
- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // Incorrect: Accessing self->myObject before initialization complete 
        [self->myObject doSomething]; // potential crash
        self.myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    }
    return self;
}
```

Another instance is within a block passed to a method like `dispatch_async`. If you retain `self` within the block without proper handling, you can create a retain cycle, leading to memory leaks, if you are not careful about managing the reference cycles.
